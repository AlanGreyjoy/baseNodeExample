# RESTful API Example

A super super watered down boiler plate to start a node server.

## Install
```bash
npm install
npm install nodemon
```
then
```bash
cd src
nodemon
```

## Test routes
These routes are for testing and demonstration.
```http request
http://localhost:3006/api/v1/groups
http://localhost:3006/api/v1/users
http://localhost:3006/api/v1/users/33
```

## Other notes
No docker, no DB, no auth. Just a basic node server structure.
I may include auth with mongo and passport later on.

## My style = my opinion
Programing is 80% opinionated. Don't get caught up in pissing matches over what you would do or what I would do.
This is not a strict language. That is the beauty of javascript. </br>
</br>
There are no set standards with this repo. </br>
import, require, whatever it takes to get the job done. </br>
importing is more primarily for front ends anyways.

Javascript is supposed to be FUN!</br>
Leave your OOP ways behind you with JAVA, C#, or any other
language you are coming from.
